My extensions for GNOME 3

## Automated publishing

This repository ships a GitHub Actions workflow that packages the extension and,
once a valid API key has been configured, automatically publishes it to
extensions.gnome.org. To enable automated updates, add the secret
`GNOME_EXTENSIONS_API_KEY` with your personal API key in the repository
settings. When a tag matching the `v*` pattern is created or the workflow is
triggered manually, it performs the following steps:

1. Install the required dependencies (`gnome-shell`, `gnome-extensions-cli`, etc.).
2. Package the extension from `lockscreen@sri.ramkrishna.me/` using
   `gnome-extensions pack` to produce a zip archive.
3. Upload the archive to extensions.gnome.org via `gext publish` through the
   helper script `scripts/publish_to_gnome_extensions.py`.
4. Attach the built package as a workflow artifact.

This keeps the extension on extensions.gnome.org up to date automatically
without needing to generate a zip archive locally.
